## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

At first, i thought it would be a walk in the park when i first saw the challenge. Css is quite complicated i must confess. Having to get to understand "build for mobile frst" is something i need to read more on. As most people know that media queries are quite tricky. With errors and researches i was able to finish this challenge. Not as perfect but it is quite close. Coding is something you have to practice everyday, even if it is just for 10 mins a day. You leave it, you forget it!. Patience is alos important when it comes to getting the hang of coding. Take your time, no need to rush.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  margin: auto;
}
```


### Continued development

I will definetly focus more on media queries, css grid and pesudo classes.
